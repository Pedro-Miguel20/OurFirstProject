## Registering users with HTML and PHP

Typically, a web page has a landing page, but we decided to begin with the sign-up system since it will help determine a database setup.
This system is composed of four inputs from HTML. The connection with the database will be made using PHP.
Using HTML, we can define the building blocks of the signup system. It is worth noting that this can be done using Bootstrap, but it is always good to exercise to practice the basics of HTML.
